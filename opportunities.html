    <p><b>Opportunities presented by the integration of Virtual reality in medical practices and education </b></p>
    <p>Since the invention of the first Virtual reality machine In 1968 by inventor Ivan Sutherland, the enhancement of this area of technology has grown at an exponential rate. VR is primarily known for its uses in entertainment but in the past decade its been explored for its potential uses in different areas in society. In this page we explore the opportunities that VR has presented in the medical field of society through case studies done to prove the effectiveness of VR and its potentials in the medical field.</p>
    <p><b>CASE STUDY: Effectiveness of Virtual Reality Training in Orthopedic Surgery</b></p>
        <p>Purpose</p>
        <p>The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review to determine the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) training in orthopaedic surgery.</p>
        <p>Methods</p>
        <p>A comprehensive systematic review was performed of articles of VR training in orthopaedic surgery published up to November 2014 from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases.</p>
        <p>Results</p>
        <p>We included 10 relevant trials of 91 identified articles, which all reported on training in arthroscopic surgery (shoulder, n = 5; knee, n = 4; undefined, n = 1). A total of 303 participants were involved. Assessment after training was made on a simulator in 9 of the 10 studies, and in one study it took place in the operating room (OR) on a real patient. A total of 32 different outcomes were extracted; 29 of them were about skills assessment. None involved a patient-related outcome. One study focused on anatomic learning, and the other evaluated technical task performance before and after training on a VR simulator. Five studies established construct validity. Three studies reported a statistically significant improvement in technical skills after training on a VR simulator.</p>
        <p>Conclusions</p>
        <p>VR training leads to an improvement of technical skills in orthopaedic surgery. Before its widespread use, additional trials are needed to clarify the transfer of VR training to the OR.</p>

    <p><b>Computers and virtual reality for surgical education in the 21st century</b></p>
    <p>A case study conducted by Randy S. Haluck and Thomas M. Krummel</p>
    <p>-	“Computer-based training in technical skills has the potential to solve many of the educational economical, ethical, and patient safety issues related to learning to perform operations”</p>
    <p>-	“Computer-based surgical simulation, often referred to as virtual reality, holds enormous potential for enhancing surgical training”</p>
    <p>-	Virtual reality in surgical training challenges the age-old method of learning surgical practices called the Halstedian method. This method describes a “see one, do one, teach one” process of learning.</p>
    <p><b>Cons of the Halstedian method</b></p>
    <p>-	Learning surgical practices via the Halstedian method often requires surgical residents and practicing surgeons to witness and attend to a live surgical operation in an Operating Room. </p>
    <p>-	This method of teaching is live and direct and typically unpredictable. </p>
    <p>-	The lead surgeon/instructor does not have much flexibility in their delivery of teaching as they must prioritize the patient over educational goals (i.e they can’t unstitch a wound to show them how to stitch the wound again). </p>
    <p>-	Factors affecting the students learning abilities may be caused by a stressful learning environment that can’t be avoided due to the nature of their surroundings and circumstances.</p>
    <p>-	It is assumed that the surgeon in practice always has an appropriately experience mentor available which is not always the case</p>
    <p>-	The Operating Room, therefore, makes for a suboptimal learning environment. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Visuospatial Ability</b></p>
    <p>-	For this section, ability is defined as inherent or innate skills. Skills, on the other hand, can be learned and refined</p>
    <p>-	Visuospatial ability is the ability to represent a 3-dimensional situation mentally using key landmarks and to have a clear mental picture of their relationships in space</p>
    <p>-	surgeons with high proficiency in this area of mental ability proved to have higher levels of surgical skill.</p>
    <p>-	Residents with enhance visuospatial abilities had increased capacities to store more sophisticated collections of motor skills.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>This case study therefore poses the question of "How should surgical skills be taught?"</b></p>
    <p>-	Learning outside the OR is tremendously advantageous because the learning environment can be more easily controlled</p>
    <p>-	An ideal learning environment allows students to practice, iteratively, larger procedural components. These practices usually involve the use of  inanimate models or animate models such as pigs and dogs.</p>
    <p>-	The use of animals in surgical training poses an ethical problem and adds to costs which is a limitation to learning potential. Maintenance of these resources is also a limitation</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Virtual reality as a potential solution</b></p>
    <p>-	Computer generated surgical simulations doesn’t require the maintenance of physical resources and tools. </p>
    <p>-	VR is a more flexible learning tool. Students can dismiss themselves in the middle of a virtual operation if they feel overwhelmed or exhausted and there is no patient at risk during the whole process</p>
    <p>-	Students will be able to repeatedly perform surgical tasks as many times as necessary.</p>
    <p>-	Students can pick tasks to perform and practice instead of waiting for a case situation.</p>
    <p>-	This article suggests that by moderating levels of stress during learning outside the OR using VR as a means of optimum preparations they effectively decrease the levels of stress while inside the OR hence increasing learning potential while in the OR.</p>
    <p>Doctors Randy and Thomas used the Yerkes Dodson law to model the optimum levels of stress someone should be subjected to for optimum performance</p>
    <p>The image below shows the relationship between performance and stress as modeled by Yerkes and Dodson</p>
    <p><img src = /images/Normal_Curve.jpg> </p>
    <p>The Yerkes–Dodson law is an empirical relationship between pressure and performance, originally developed by psychologists Robert M. Yerkes and John Dillingham Dodson in 1908. The law dictates that performance increases with physiological or mental arousal, but only up to a point.</p>
    <p>-	In 1908, psychologists Robert Yerkes and John Dillingham Dodson conducted an experiment on rats completing a maze under stress. They discovered that the relationship between stress and performance suggests that performance increases as stress increases but only up to a certain point at which point performance begins to decrease. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
    <p>-	Resource and tool efficiency </p>
    <p>-	Ethical and financial limitations</p>
    <p>-	Improving learning potential and quality within the OR</p>
    <p>-	Enhancing learning outside the OR</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>CASE STUDY: The financial impact of teaching surgical residents in the operating room</b></p>
    <p>-	In a 1999 publication of the study on the financial impact of teaching surgical residents in the operating room, Doctors Matthew Bridges and Daniel L Diamond found that in the US, the annual cost of training residents in the OR is 53 million USD and the cost per graduating student was $47,970. </p>
    <p>-	Their conclusion suggested “the need for digital skills….the development of training curriculums….and perhaps the possibility of virtual surgery training modules.”</p>
    <p>-	In the late 90's when technology in the virtual reality field was not yet as advanced as today, the idea of virtual training systems for medical practices had already started arising.</p>
    <p>Current technological enhancements in medical education involving virtual reality</p>

    <p>-	This is an image of a person using VR to simulate precision cutting a piece of fabric which mimics basic laparoscopic practices </p>
    <p>-	This VR system is called VBlaST and in this image the person is currently on a pattern cutting simulation</p>

    <p>-	This image shows what you would see while using the Pattern Cutting Simualtion of the VBLaST system.</p>
    <p><b>Virtual reality training for surgical trainees in laparoscopic surgery</b></p>
    <p>-	A case study published in 2007 by the Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews, investigates the effects of VR for surgical trainees in laparoscopic surgery. </p>
    <p>-	The experiment compared 3 groups of surgical trainees with limited laparoscopic experience. One group was trained using VR, one was trained using a traditional box-trainer training method and the last group was a control group which received no supplementary training.</p>
    <p>-	 Their results showed that those who trained using VR had significantly lower operating times and higher operative performances than the other groups.</p>

    <p><b>Potential uses for VR in other branches of healthcare and medicine</b></p>
    <p>Autism and VR</p>
    <p>In 1996, The idea of using VR as a learning tool for children on the autistic spectrum was first studied by Dorothy Strickland</p>
    <p>Brief Report: Two Case Studies Using Virtual Reality as a Learning Tool for Autistic Children 1 </p>
   
        <p>-	The study's aim was to determine weather children on the autistic spectrum would accept/tolerate VR equipment and respond the computer-generated world in a meaningful way.</p>
        <p>-	Two case studies were conducted with this aim and concluded that the children were able to comply with the VR equipment and interact with the VR environment in a meaningful way</p>
    <p>This study had inconclusive results due to a lot of the uncertainties </p>
   
        <p>	Such a small study sample, need more research to verify the potential uses of VR in this area.</p>
    <p>They were limited by the technology available at the time and the understanding of autism</p>
    
    <p>Autism and virtual reality head-mounted displays: a state-of-the-art systematic review</p>
    
        <p>-	In 2018, a review on the implementation of VR technologies in the education of people on the autistic spectrum  </p>
        <p>  -	This review doesn't condemn the use of VR in this area</p>
            <p> -	This review states that further investigation is required to verify VR as a valid method of educating autistic children</p>
                <p>   -	This review states that studies using HMD virtual technologies have shown potential for learning and assessment of people on the autistic spectrum and that it is therefore surprising that very little research has emerged in this field since the first study by Stickland in 1996. There are ground for optimism.</p>
  </p>
<p>The lack of conclusive proof that VR effectively assists in education for people on the autistic spectrum has proved to be a talking point for medical reports. Each case studied involved in VR and autism has produced results that confirm grounds of optimism providing an oppurtunity to explore this area of technological usage.</p>
