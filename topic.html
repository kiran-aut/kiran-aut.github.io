    <p>Our group will be focusing on the integration of virtual reality in the medical environment, and its benefits for several parties such as aiding children with autism, and benefiting elderly citizens with general fitness and health.</p>
    <p>Virtual reality has been tested in the medical field dating back to the 1990's. Since then, the medical practices that involve virtual reality have evolved in an interesting way and its capabilities are ever extending to further fields of therapy and health care. Although virtual reality has its benefits in society, it still has its negative implications on communities and individuals which should be addressed.</p>
    <p>It's important to discuss the matters involving technology in the medical and health care areas so that we can direct the use of technology into places that benefit society.</p>
