    <p>I personally believe that VR is a promising new way of approaching healthcare. The benefits it can and could offer, I think, seem to outweigh the seemingly very minor downsides. Providing doctors a way to train for highly technical and difficult surgeries for example without endangering any lives seems very promising. For the patient perspective, I think that VR has high usefulness in therapy for trauma victims. I think children may benefit the most from VR in healthcare because it can make things more exciting and less scary when it's presented in a fun way. I think ethically VR has a place in healthcare, as long as it is carried out in a moral way, with sensitive applications for those who may need it.</p>

    <p>Technological advancements in human history has been a double edged sword. in recent centuries advancements to combat climate change have been significant but so has the advancements in military technological warfare. Our website showcases the advancements of technology in directions that are beneficial and not destructive. The more we look into how technology can be used, the opportunities, choices and the risks posed by uses of technology, the more we begin to direct the advancments of technology into areas that progress human society.</p>

    <p>In relflection of the assignment and of the topic of virtual reality integrating in the medical envrionment, i can now understand that virtual reality is aiding us in many pursuits of helping medically ill indivduals. Yes there are risks involved in the envornment such as the health downsides invloved in prolonged use of a screen being close to eyes for extended amounts of time, but it still has outweighing benefits in my opinion that can help us in many factors of life. I consider that virtual reality is a 1st world advancement that must be included in 3rd world countries in aiding them in healthcare due to the many opportunities and issues that arise out of those communities due to the lack of resoursing. My standpoint on virtual reality is that it will lead us into a finer future and will undoubtubly aid us in the preservation of life.</p>
