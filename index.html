    <p> With an ever advancing technological world there have been multiple improvements to society with this idea that we call computation. The benefits cover a large range of concepts such as improving social interactions, aiding in health and wellbeing, and simplifying many tasks. In our case we are focusing on how virtual reality is integrating with medicine and healthcare, therefore computation is aiding us in health. In my description I will unveil the concept of the choices made in this space and how leading forward this virtual reality can enhance the current ideas in the space and create new ones.

    <p>  A choice that has been made in the virtual reality space that I have considered is how virtual reality is being chosen in learning environments. One example of this is seen in some international police forces such as the Cyprus Police Force. It is stated that due to virtual reality “scenarios will be easy to author and police officers will be better trained in an immersive 3D environment”( Himona et al., 2011, p.g 12). Another case where we can source usage of choosing to implement learning methods of virtual reality into the classroom is in wording such as “Looking at the world, we absorb the equivalent of a billion bits of information per second, as much as the text in 1,000 copies of a magazine. But our mental 'text computer' is limited by the fact that we can read only about 1 00 bites - or characters - per second”(1992, Helsel, p.g 6). These examples of the influx in usage of choosing to use virtual reality in the education industry shows us that it could benefit parties such as the medical industry in their education methods for training newly recruited prospects in the field and therefore aid health and wellbeing of society.  </p>
