    <p>While Virtual Reality (VR) has many positive impacts on the healthcare industry, and healthcare as a whole, it does not mean that it is without its risks. The uses for VR in healthcare are numerous, ranging from a safe training environment for new surgeons, or even for experienced medical practitioners preparing for highly dangerous surgeries. They also allow for experiences such as PTSD treatment for military veterans. However, there are some downsides to this. </p>
    <p><a href = https://kiran-aut.github.io/references.html>Baniasadi &  Mohammadzadeh (2020)</a> state in their research that there are limitations and challenges in the field of VR healthcare, specifically in the usefulness and misuse of VR in practical applications. They found that in terms of general risks of VR in healthcare, the reduced face-to-face communication occurring between the patients and doctors was a key risk. This reduced face-to-face communication created a barrier between the doctor and patient, which has potential to harm the level of care and understanding between the two parties.</p>
    <p>Training and education of healthcare workers to use and understand the VR systems in a competent and detailed enough way was a risk. The implementation of VR systems in healthcare adds a whole new layer of training required. This results in another vector for mistakes to occur to be wide. The training needed is in-depth as healthcare requires the highest standard of operations to be effective. This can be both costly for healthcare systems, both private and publicly funded <a href = https://kiran-aut.github.io/references.html>(Kyaw et al., 2019)</a>. New Zealand’s healthcare system is already struggling for funding as it is, and the implementation of VR systems could be a net negative for the level of healthcare for this reason alone.</p>
    <p>In their work, <a href = https://kiran-aut.github.io/references.html>Baniasadi &  Mohammadzadeh (2020)</a> also make note of the attitudes of patients. For some patients unfamiliar or uncomfortable with IT solutions, the use of VR may be a negative because of their negative attitudes towards it. This could manifest in excess stress or worry, negating all benefits the VR system was intended to provide. </p>
    <p>They also make note of the fact that VR systems should only be used as healthcare when prescribed by clinical professionals. The relative ease of access for VR systems at home means that some patients may be inclined to take treatment into their own hands, which can be a severely negative outcome. </p>
    <p><a href = https://kiran-aut.github.io/references.html>Fertleman et al. (2018)</a> state that while VR in healthcare is a promising new paradigm of healthcare and healthcare, significantly more money and research is needed to confirm its efficacy. These pose risks to already struggling healthcare systems. </p>
    <p><a href = https://kiran-aut.github.io/references.html>Lányi (n.d)</a> discussed the issue with children and VR in their work. This paper discussed how exposing children to VR in a healthcare environment can cause children to want to use VR in their own time, at home or with friends and often without supervision. Looking at some VR game store pages, many of the most popular VR video games are extremely violent in nature. <a href = https://kiran-aut.github.io/references.html>According to Lányi (n.d)</a>, youth VR exposure leads to heightened feelings and expressions of aggression. A key risk of VR in healthcare is the idea of prematurely exposing vulnerable populations of people to this functionally brand new technology. It is likely that parents or caregivers may not understand the technology their children are being exposed to in healthcare settings, and may purchase it for home use as well, linking with the prior mention of self-healthcare due to VR exposure.</p>
    <p>There has been ample research into the direct risks of high VR exposure for years. For example <a href = https://kiran-aut.github.io/references.html>Kaimara & Deliyannis (2021)</a> a have a study into the risks of VR exposure to children and adolescents. They have found that high levels of VR usage is linked to eyesight issues, headaches, and other ill or adverse effects.</p>
