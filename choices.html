    <p>Choices
    </p>
<p>With an ever advancing technological world there have been multiple improvements to society with this idea that we call computation. The benefits cover a large range of concepts such as improving social interactions, aiding in health and wellbeing, and simplifying many tasks. In our case we are focusing on how virtual reality is integrating with medicine and healthcare, therefore computation is aiding us in health. In my description I will unveil the concept of the choices made in this space and how leading forward this virtual reality can enhance the current ideas in the space and create new ones. </p>
<p>A choice that has been made in the virtual reality space that I have considered is how virtual reality is being chosen in learning environments. One example of this is seen in some international police forces such as the Cyprus Police Force. It is stated that due to virtual reality “scenarios will be easy to author and police officers will be better trained in an immersive 3D environment”<a href = https://kiran-aut.github.io/references.html%3E ( Himona et al., 2011, p.g 12) </a></a>. Another case where we can source usage of choosing to implement learning methods of virtual reality into the classroom is in wording such as “Looking at the world, we absorb the equivalent of a billion bits of information per second, as much as the text in 1,000 copies of a magazine. But our mental 'text computer' is limited by the fact that we can read only about 1 00 bites - or characters - per second”<a href = https://kiran-aut.github.io/references.html%3E (1992, Helsel, p.g 6) </a></a>. These examples of the influx in usage of choosing to use virtual reality in the education industry shows us that it could benefit parties such as the medical industry in their education methods for training newly recruited prospects in the field and therefore aid health and wellbeing of society. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, As Virtual reality tools are being made and software is being developed to facilitate experiments we can see a clear view on how food selection in virtual reality is linked to the real world. One example of this is found in a study from students attending Tsinghua University. The students found that if the color of the table cloth in a virtually simulated restaurant is changed, the result is a less inclined taste for meat heavy meals and a more inclined taste for vegetable-forward meals if the tablecloth is red in color <a href = https://kiran-aut.github.io/references.html%3E (Wan et al., 2021) </a></a>. Another example of the usage of virtual reality to unveil real life choices and decisions in the food sector is in an experiment conducted by another group of university students. The students experimented on the choices consumers make while at a food court. (ref appendix A) As we can see in the data the percentage at which healthy food options compared to cheaper fast food is less and therefore shows us that current consumers are not focusing on healthy eating practices when they purchase their food. We can identify that it is leading to this due to the assistance of virtual reality in the experiment. From the data and going through the experimental process the students concluded that “Virtual reality shows promise as a tool to study food choice”(Allman-Farinelli et al., p.g 1, 2019). Both of these studies enforce the idea that virtual reality is aiding in consciously thinking when it comes to food selection and how this can impact on health.
</p>
<p>Institutions in the food sector and education sector are actively choosing to implement virtual reality platforms into their teaching and learning practices. Therefore we can understand that virtual reality is benefitting the health of the public currently and is aiding in new discoveries. I consider that leading forward into the future, we will see more usage of virtual reality as a whole which will benefit and quicken human development over time. Therefore the ingenuity behind virtual reality is going to advance civilization and create new processes and feature in the existence of humankind. </p>
